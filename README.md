# Hogwarts JS Summer Camp

This repository contains some examples for an introduction to JavaScript.

These examples include:

1. Primitive data types in JS and basic interaction (`alert()`, `prompt()`)
2. Object structure and simple comparisons
3. Introduction to function declarations
4. Creating DOM elements and removing them from the DOM structure

**Hint**: In order to inspect the several examples just link the respective JS file in provided `script` tag of the `index.html` file, as for instance:

```html
<h1>Hogwarts JS Summer Camp</h1>
<script src="4-create-dom-elements.js"></script>
```
